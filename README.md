## Setup

Download the latest release and save it anywhere on your PC. (MS Edge thinks it has a virus because it's a `.exe` file. Don't worry, it's safe.)

Windows may also think it's a dangerous file due to it being unsigned.

To allow the installer to run, click `More Info` then `Run Anyway`

## Getting started

If you just want to play Botw (maybe with mods too), [this guide](guide) will get you there.

If you want to go further and make a custom install to your machine, short explanations of each button are written under **Usage**.

## Basic Tab Usage

### Use Mods:
> Installs python (3.7 by default), Edge WebView 2 Runtime, and BCML. This must be checked (green) if you want to play Botw with mods.

### Create Shortcuts
> Fairly self-explanatory, this creates Desktop, Start, and Program shortcuts (uninstallers) for Cemu, BCML, and Botw. The shortcuts created are defined in the advanced tab.

### Run After Install
> Runs Botw after installation.

### None; DS4Windows; BetterJoy
> These applications are required to connect unsupported controllers (DualShock4, Switch joycons, etc) to Windows to then use in Cemu.
To find out if you need one, see [this list](list).

### Cemu Path
> This is the path to your Cemu folder. (Folder containing Cemu.exe.) This defaults to `C:\Users\%username%\Games\Cemu`.
It can be changed of course, but it's recommended you don't point it to a folder inside Documents.

### Dump Path
> This is the path to your game files. (Files dumped from your WiiU.) If you are unsure where these are, you can try the search feature, it will look for your game files, but it takes a while and can be fooled. It's recommended to set your Dump Path manually.
