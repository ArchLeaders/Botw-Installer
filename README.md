## Setup

Download the latest release and save it anywhere on your PC. (MS Edge thinks it has a virus because it's a `.exe` file. Don't worry, it's safe.)

Windows may also think it's a dangerous file due to it being unsigned.

To allow the installer to run, click `More Info` then `Run Anyway`

## Getting started

This short guide will get you up and running Botw as quickly as possible. Contact me via [Discord](https://discord.gg/cbA3AWwfJj) if you encountered any issues.

### Requirments

> Botw v1.5 (WiiU Version)
>
> Empty SD Card with at least 15GB of free space.
>
> A decent pc. ([See actual requirments](https://wiki.cemu.info/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild))
> 
> Windows 10 or 11. (7 & 8 _may_ work but aren't tested)

### Dumping your game files

1. Insert your empty SD Card and format it as Fat32.
2. Download [HomebrewSetup](https://github.com/ArchLeaders/Breath-of-the-Wild-Installer-NET-6.0/releases/download/v1.0.0/HomebrewSetup.exe) and point it to your SD Card.

   *Eg. if you have a primary C: drive and your SD card is drive D:, enter `D` into the console window.*
   
3. Open the web browser on your WiiU and go to `wiiuexploit.xyz` click enter homebrew.
4. Once it's loaded, launch the Dumpling app.
5. Inside Dumpling, select either `Dump digital games` or `Dump a game disc` depending on whichever Botw is.
6. Select BotW using the `A` button and press `Start (+)`. (Selection not applicable if dumping the disc copy.)
7. Set the dump destination to your SD Card.
8. press the `Start (+)` button to begin dumping. This may take a very long time.
9. Once it's complete, remove the SD Card and plug it into your pc. Copy the game files of your SD card if you wish, or check the `Copy Base To mlc01` button in Botw Installer.

### Installing With Botw Installer

1. If you didn't move the files off of your SD Card, open the advanced tab and click `Copy Base To mlc01` so it turns green. 

   *Change any other settings until it's just how you want it. (Read the tooltips for explanations and take note that the Base Game, Update, and DLC paths will be auto-filled when you click install or fill out `Dump Path` in the basic tab.)*

2. Click install. If you **did** move your game files from the SD Card fill out `Dump Path` first.
3. Let the tool do its job and wait for the prompt saying it's complete. (If any errors occur please report them to me.)
4. That's it. Botw is now installed.
